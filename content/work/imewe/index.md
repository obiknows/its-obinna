IMEWE is a agency I created to satisfy the requests that I get to build
different projects. Whether its branding for new businesses, a random logo,
a custom website, or a whole app: IMEWE uses our 3 step process to get it done.

---

**Dream**: First we gotta sit with the Idea and get it to its best form. That's the Dream. The highest form of the Idea.

**Design**: Then you gotta get with the arts and crafts and create the elements of Dream so that it becomes tangible.
Whether its a logo, a brand, apparel, the website pages, or the app screens.

**Deliver**: Finally, the real work, we start to write the code, make the apparel and finalize designs. And then we deliver.

The name IMEWE comes from an Igbo word meaning to design or to manufacture.
