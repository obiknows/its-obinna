Our Soul Agenda is my and my ladies project. It's our platform that we use to reach out to other people seeking freedom
or looking to learn about nomad living, entrepreneurship, and looking for a path to financial freedom and freedom from the 9-5 rat race.

AÃ¯ssatou handles all of the social media, the film editing, photoshoots, blog writing and more. Pretty much everything.

What I did was make our nice new [website](https://oursoulagenda.com) and [blog](https://oursoulagenda.com/blog), redesigned our logo and created apparel which you can buy at our Soul Shop [here](https://oursoulagenda.bigcartel.com).

You can see some of our apparel and screenshots of the site below.
