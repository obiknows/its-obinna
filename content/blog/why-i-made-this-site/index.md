### Welcome to It's Obinna. My names Obinna, and if you're reading this I wanna say Thank You.

You taking time out your life to read something I wrote and that means something to me.

Unless you the Feds. Then fuck you.

I made this blog to be able to build business, to share & express truth, and have a platform to say what the fuck I feel, absent censorship.

hol' up....

In order to read this in its full magnificence, play the song Dambala by Nina Simone while you read the rest of this letter.

I'm writing this to leave some info and clues for my sisters and brothers who find themselves drawn to truth and light
in a world of confusion. I want to emphasize that although It's Obinna, although it has my name, and I use it to promote my business and things, ain't really about me.

In the culture which I was born, Igbo. OBINNA has a meaning that I am only beginning to learn about,

**OBI** means the heart, the soul, the spirit, the breath that flows in us all and make us that which we uniquely are.

And, **NNA** means man or father, in the simplest sense. However as I learned in this tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A man and child from Igbariam, c. 1911. MAA Cambridge.<br><br>Originally, nna (father) Igbo names did not reference a monotheistic deity, neither were they necessarily about a person&#39;s direct father. Nna names are about the collective of ancestors and all who come under them (umunna). <a href="https://t.co/YiYZ9A8goz">pic.twitter.com/YiYZ9A8goz</a></p>&mdash; Ụ́kpụ́rụ́ (@ukpuru) <a href="https://twitter.com/ukpuru/status/1228051693956485121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

**NNA** is about **the collective of ancestors and all those who come after**.

Putting the two together, the ancestors have revealed to me that it is my purpose to channel the will of the collective ancestors (I'm talking about us now...), to touch the heart, soul and spirit, of as many of us as I can, and to provide and protect for those who will come after us.

As long as I do that, then I got power pumpin in my veins and I have life. And once my time is up. It's up.

> If you only knew how powerful your heart and the all the blood in your body is....

I know that we were all placed here with a purpose greater than ourselves. The goal in life seems to realize this in the short amount of time that we're given.

My purpose at this moment is to spread truth, light, inspiration, and assist my people in returning to their former glory.

Let me rephrase that.

My goal is to help us realize what we never lost, only what we lost sight of, our glory.

Well that's my purpose. The rest, well that may be what you're here to do.

And I made this site to help us do that.

I'm here to build with you. Just holla at me.
